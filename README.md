# StickyBookmarks

StickyBookmarks is a sublime plugin that improves the way sublime handles bookmarks in the following ways:
- Follow the bookmarks when a file has changed (instead of using the character offset, also use contextual info)
- Keep a list of bookmarks in memory, also for closed files, this list can be shown to quickly see and browse the the bookmarks
- Remove all bookmarks in a project/file

# Disclaimer
This is a very early release and probably has lots of bugs in it, work is done an a best effort basis. Pull requests with features or bugfixes are appreciated.
